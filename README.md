## **Problem Statement**  

Creating high-quality datasets is a critical challenge for developers building AI-powered applications. Many developers face these issues:  

1. **Lack of Data**: Developers often donâ€™t have access to sufficient data to train or fine-tune models.  
2. **Limited Tools**: Existing tools for generating synthetic data are either too complex or fail to prioritize data correctness.  
3. **Data Validation**: Ensuring the generated datasets are clean, structured, and ready for immediate use in AI systems is often overlooked.  
4. **Transparency**: Developers lack visibility into how datasets are generated, making debugging and trust-building difficult.  

---

## **Our Approach**  

The **Synthetic Data Generator App** solves these challenges by providing:  

- **A Transparent Workflow**: We break down the data generation process into clear, visual steps, empowering developers to understand and customize the flow.  
- **Schema Validation**: We prioritize data correctness by enforcing schema validation to ensure the generated datasets meet developer-defined standards.  
- **Ease of Use**: A simple, visually engaging interface makes dataset generation accessible to both technical and non-technical users.  
- **Extensibility**: Designed as an extensible tool, the app can adapt to various use cases beyond the MVP, such as data augmentation, multi-language support, and more.

## **Features Overview**  

The Synthetic Data Generator App provides an intuitive end-to-end workflow for generating high-quality datasets.  

### **Key Features**  

1. **Data Input**:  
   - Upload knowledge bases or existing datasets in CSV or TXT format.  
   - Manually input data via a form for smaller use cases.  

2. **Workflow Visualization**:  
   - Visualize the data generation process step-by-step
   - Key steps include:  
     - **Analyzing Examples**: Extract patterns and insights.  
     - **Planning**: Break down the generation process into manageable tasks, such as chunking, reasoning, and output formatting.  
     - **Generation**: Create synthetic Q&A datasets using LLMs.  
     - **Validation**: Apply schema rules to ensure correctness.  

3. **Synthetic Data Generation**:  
   - Generate Q&A pairs, FAQs, or other structured datasets.  
   - Support multiple prompting techniques:  
     - Basic prompting.  
     - Few-shot/multi-shot prompting.  
     - Feedback-based repair mechanisms.  

4. **Validation and Schema Support**:  
   - Use our **Schema UI** to define structured schemas for your datasets.  
   - Support for custom JSON-schema for advanced users.  

5. **Dataset Management**:  
   - Save datasets as CSV files.  
   - Maintain a history of generated datasets for easy review, download, and deletion.

## **MVP Highlights**  

The MVP focuses on generating **Q&A datasets from knowledge bases**. Key features in the MVP include:  

1. **Knowledge Base Upload**: Upload your knowledge base in CSV or TXT format.  
2. **Step-by-Step Workflow**:  
   - Analyze examples (if provided).  
   - Plan the data generation process with visual representation.  
   - Generate questions, answers, and extract supporting text using LLMs.  
3. **Self Critic Agentic Workflow**
4. **Validation**:  
   - Enforce schema validation to ensure data correctness.  
   - Provide a simple schema creation UI and JSON-schema support.  
5. **Export and History**:  
   - Save your datasets as CSV files.  
   - View and manage previously generated datasets in the **Dataset History** tab.

## **Installation**  

To get started with the Synthetic Data Generator App, follow these steps:  

### **Requirements**  
- Python 3.9+  
- Streamlit 1.25+  
- OpenAI API Key (for LLM-based data generation)
- Groq API Key (for high-performance inference)
- llama-stack with Groq support

### **Setting up llama-stack with Groq**

1. Clone the llama-stack repository with Groq support:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swanhtet1992/llama-stack.git
   cd llama-stack
   git checkout groq
   ```

2. Install llama-stack:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Build the llama-stack distribution with Groq template:
   ```bash
   llama stack build --template groq
   ```
   This will create necessary configuration files for running llama-stack with Groq.

4. Start the llama-stack server:
   ```bash
   llama stack run groq --port 5001
   ```
   The server will be available at `http://localhost:5001`

5. Verify the server is running by checking the health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5001/alpha/health
   ```

For more detailed information about building llama-stack distributions, refer to the [official documentation](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/distributions/building_distro.html).

### **Setting up the Synthetic Data Generator**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/synthetic-data-generator.git  
   cd synthetic-data-generator  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
    pip install uv (if you don't have)
    uv init  
    uv install  
   ```  

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file
   touch .env

   # Add the following variables
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   LLAMA_STACK_URL=http://localhost:5001
   ```

4. Run the app:  
   ```bash  
    streamlit run app.py  
   ```  

5. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.  

### **Troubleshooting llama-stack**

If you encounter issues with llama-stack:

1. Verify your Groq API key is correctly set in the environment
2. Check the llama-stack server logs for any error messages
3. Ensure the server port (5001) is not being used by another application
4. If the build fails, try cleaning the build directory:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.llama/distributions/
   llama stack build --template groq
   ```

For additional help, refer to the [llama-stack documentation](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/) or open an issue in the repository.
